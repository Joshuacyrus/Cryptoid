Cryptoid
========

Cryptoid  the first Android application I have developed. The purpose of this application is to cipher and decipher messages with basic algorithms like Caesar, Vigenere..
An article and screenshots are available here: http://robindavid.comli.com/cryptoid/

Note
----

* There is few minimal bugs in the application and some algorithms are not implemented
* I provide sources as Eclipse project to easily import it
* The application itself is available in the bin directory
